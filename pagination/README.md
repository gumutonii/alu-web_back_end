### Pagination
Pagination is a technique used in REST APIs to split large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks, enabling efficient data transfer and user-friendly interfaces. 

## Key Elements of Pagination
- Page Numbering: Splits data into pages based on the current page number and page size.
- Offset and Limit: Uses an offset to skip a certain number of records and a limit to define the number of records per page.
