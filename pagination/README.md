### Pagination
Pagination is a technique used in REST APIs to split large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks, enabling efficient data transfer and user-friendly interfaces. It limits the number of records returned per request, reducing the load on the server and improving response times. Here's how you can implement pagination in Python for a REST API:

## Key Elements of Pagination
- Page Numbering: Splits data into pages based on the current page number and page size.
- Offset and Limit: Uses an offset to skip a certain number of records and a limit to define the number of records per page.
- Cursor-Based: Uses a unique identifier (e.g., a timestamp or database ID) to fetch the next set of results.
